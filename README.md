The AsieLauncher is a launcher for custom modpacks. 

Created with the serious server administrator in mind, it allows all clients with the modpack to be automatically and incrementally updated when mods or configs change on the server. 

On the server side, the AsieLauncher uses Node.js, and a simple java client is generated specific to the server.

To install and use, please see the wiki.
